# Medical Text Classification using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying medical texts using neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop an accurate and robust classification model that can effectively categorize medical texts into different classes based on their content.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the "20 Newsgroups" dataset, which consists of a collection of newsgroup documents on various topics. For this project, we specifically focus on the subset of medical-related newsgroup posts. The dataset is pre-processed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Preprocessing
Text preprocessing is an essential step in NLP tasks. The project performs preprocessing on the medical texts, including tokenization, removal of stop words, lemmatization, and vectorization using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation. These steps help transform the raw text into a format suitable for training the neural network models.

## Neural Network Models
The project explores the use of various neural network architectures for medical text classification, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Each model is built using popular deep learning libraries like Keras and TensorFlow.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The neural network models are trained on the preprocessed text data and evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of different models is compared to identify the most effective architecture for medical text classification.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize the performance of the neural network models, hyperparameter tuning is conducted using techniques like grid search and cross-validation. This helps identify the best combination of hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, activation functions, and learning rates, to achieve higher accuracy and robustness.

## Results and Discussion
The project presents the results of the trained models, including classification reports and accuracy scores, to assess their performance on the test set. The findings are discussed in terms of the strengths and limitations of each model, as well as potential areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of neural networks and NLP techniques for medical text classification. By leveraging the power of deep learning, it aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of categorizing medical texts, which can have valuable applications in healthcare, information retrieval, and decision support systems.
