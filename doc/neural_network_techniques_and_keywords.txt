Neural Network Techniques and Keywords

Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the interconnected network of neurons in the human brain. They have become widely used for solving complex tasks in various domains, including natural language processing and image recognition. In this document, we provide explanations and definitions for the neural network techniques used in this project, along with relevant keywords.

1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):
   - BERT is a state-of-the-art language model that utilizes a transformer architecture to understand the contextual meaning of words in a sentence. It can capture relationships between words and generate high-quality word representations.
   - Keywords: language model, transformer architecture, contextual meaning, word representations.

2. Tokenization:
   - Tokenization is the process of breaking down a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words, subwords, or characters. Tokenization helps in preparing the text data for analysis and processing by the neural network model.
   - Keywords: text splitting, tokens, word segmentation.

3. Preprocessing:
   - Preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the raw text data to improve the performance of the neural network model. It includes steps like removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, and handling special cases.
   - Keywords: data cleaning, transformation, text preparation.

4. Stop Words:
   - Stop words are common words that do not carry much meaning or significance in the context of a given task. Examples of stop words include "a," "an," "the," "is," etc. Removing stop words helps reduce noise in the text data and improves the model's ability to focus on important words.
   - Keywords: common words, noise reduction, word filtration.

5. Lemmatization:
   - Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form to simplify the vocabulary used by the neural network. It converts words to their dictionary form, which aids in reducing the complexity of the text data and ensuring consistent word representations.
   - Keywords: word reduction, base form, root form, word normalization.

6. Training and Testing:
   - Neural networks are trained on a labeled dataset to learn patterns and make predictions. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The model is exposed to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and then evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance and generalization ability.
   - Keywords: learning, predictions, evaluation, generalization.

7. Optimization:
   - Optimization techniques, such as the AdamW optimizer, are used to adjust the model's parameters during training to minimize the training loss. The optimizer makes iterative updates to the model's parameters based on the gradients computed from the training data, leading to improved model performance.
   - Keywords: parameter adjustment, loss minimization, iterative updates, performance improvement.

8. Classification Report:
   - A classification report provides insights into the performance of a classification model. It presents metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Precision represents the model's ability to correctly identify positive samples, recall indicates the model's coverage of positive samples, and F1-score is a balanced measure of precision and recall.
   - Keywords: model performance, precision, recall, F1-score, evaluation metrics.

This diagram illustrates a simplified neural network structure. The input layer represents the features or text data, which gets passed through multiple hidden layers. These hidden layers learn and extract intermediate representations from the input data. Finally, the output layer generates predictions or classifications based on the learned representations.
